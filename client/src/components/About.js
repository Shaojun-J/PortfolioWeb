                    I was born in the central region of China.
                    I used to be an embedded software development engineer with more than ten years of working
                    experience in that field. <br />
                    <br />I moved to Canada three years ago. After coming to Canada, I found that I needed further
                    study
                    in order to find my dream job here. I am taking a software development course at Vanier
                    College.
                    In
                    my free time, I like to hike and fish with my family.
